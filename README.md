# TypeSpec Muzzle

Welcome to the TypeSpec Muzzle project. This project aims to provide tooling to suppress TypeSpec linting issues from the CLI. This is useful if you want to establish a baseline suppression in your TypeSpec definition without having to disable the rules entirely. For example when starting a new project from an OpenAPI import, or trying to enable new rules with existing infringements on an existing projects.

## Usage

### CLI

1. Install the CLI with

   ```shell
   npm i -g @binkylabs/muzzle
   ```

1. Ensure the ruleset you want to suppress is also installed

   ```shell
   # example you use the @typespec/http/recommended ruleset
   npm i @typespec/http
   ```

1. Suppress all warnings generated by the ruleset

   ```shell
   typespec-muzzle main.tsp --rule-set "@typespec/http/recommended"
   ```

### API

1. Install the package with

   ```shell
   npm i -S @binkylabs/muzzle
   ```

1. Ensure the ruleset you want to suppress is also installed

   ```shell
   # example you use the @typespec/http/recommended ruleset
   npm i -S @typespec/http
   ```

1. Use the suppression method

   ```TypeScript
   import { parseTypeSpecAndSuppressEverything } from "@binkylabs/muzzle";

   await parseTypeSpecAndSuppressEverything("path/to/main.tsp", ["@typespec/http/recommended"]);
   ```

## Debugging

    ```shell
    npm i
